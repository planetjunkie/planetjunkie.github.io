title:  "Why I switched to a feature phone"
---

Hello world, Some people have started to wonder why im less active on some mobile apps like telegram and stuff

|TLDR|I switched to a feature phone, not because of a smartphone addiciton just like most of these lifestyle influencers on youtube with their "why I switched to a dumb phone" videos, I switched to a feature phone because I barely use my smartphone but I do use it for Youtube and Signal only
|NOTE|I Will not call it a "Dumbphone" because its not dumb phone to begin with, But I will refer to it as a [Feature Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone)


## Reasoning

at first I bought the [Energizer e241s [1]](https://www.gsmarena.com/energizer_energy_e241s-9569.php) because it was the cheapest [KaiOS powered Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS) in my region, the original purpose of me buying this was because I wanted to mod the thing, I sure did mod it by a little but I am not going to talk about it in this blog post.

When it arrived ironically the first thing I did was move my SD and Sim Card to the phone because I will be comepletely honest, I don't use my smartphone much other than using it for signal, whatsapp, and youtube when im on the go, but KaiOS does support whatsapp so thats crossed off the list, I still needed my phone for signal and youtube for when I am OTG [2]

## Current Experience
it has been 4 days since I used this as my main mobile device, and so far I have no problems with it, I am very quick when it comes to [T9 typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)) so this isn't a big problem of mine, infact im faster at typing on a keypad (with or without predictive text on) than on a touch screen, its wild, I really wish if there was a QWERTY KaiOS based phone, however I couldn't find anything in my region aside form a phone from Mexico and the Jio Phone 2 [3]

Thats really about it for the blog, its pretty short but its something, if you spot any spelling errors make sure to fix them at the [website repo](https://github.com/planetjunkie/planetjunkie.github.io) in the posts section, but that's about it.

Ali signing off! :D
